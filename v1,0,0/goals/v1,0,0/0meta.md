# aarg.goals Meta File

## Overview
The **aarg.goals** system is designed to provide a structured way to define, track, and manage goals at different levels. Goals are **hierarchical**, allowing for broad, long-term vision-setting at the highest level and specific, actionable steps at the lower levels.

## Structure
The system follows a **three-tiered hierarchy**:
```
aarg.goals.v1,0,0/
│-- meta.md (this file, explaining the goals system)
│-- big/
│   │-- [goal_name].md  (Major life goals with long-term vision)
│-- medium/
│   │-- [goal_name].md  (Mid-sized goals that contribute to big goals)
│-- small/
    │-- [goal_name].md  (Smaller, actionable tasks or milestones)
```

## Goal Tiers
- **Big Goals (`big/`)** → High-level, long-term vision statements.
- **Medium Goals (`medium/`)** → Milestones that move big goals forward.
- **Small Goals (`small/`)** → Concrete, short-term tasks required to progress toward medium and big goals.

## Naming Conventions
Each goal file should be named descriptively using lowercase, hyphenated names:
```
aarg.goals.v1,0,0.big.get-a-house.md
```
If a goal is revised significantly, it should be **versioned accordingly**.

## Purpose of This System
- **Ensures a structured, logical approach to goal-setting**
- **Breaks down large goals into manageable steps**
- **Maintains historical context through versioning**
- **Provides clarity in tracking progress and prioritization**
