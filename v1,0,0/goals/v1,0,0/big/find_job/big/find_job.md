#### **Find a Job Where I Am Respected**  

**Description:**  
I will secure a **software engineering job** in a **STEM-related industry** by **June 1st, 2025**, that pays at least **$130,000 per year** or **$65/hr** if contract-based. The role must explicitly include **"Software" or "Engineer"** in the title. The work environment must be **respectful of my time**, meaning I am fully committed to the business’s needs from **9 AM – 5 PM in my manager’s local time zone**, but my time outside of these hours remains entirely **my own** with **no expectation of unpaid overtime or weekend work**. Additionally, my **coworkers should seek my feedback and knowledge**, and I should develop **friendships** with them, ensuring a collaborative and fulfilling professional experience.  

To achieve this, I will act as my own **career agent**, approaching the job search systematically. I will use **ChatGPT as an agent assistant** to discuss leads, evaluate offers, and assist in **negotiation strategies** to maximize my success.
