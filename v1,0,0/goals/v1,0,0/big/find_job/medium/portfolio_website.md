#### **Create a Portfolio Website at austingibb.com**

**Description:**  
Build and host a personal portfolio website at austingibb.com that showcases key projects and professional experience. This website should clearly demonstrate your technical competencies and provide parity with your resume information by featuring:

- **GitHub Repository Demonstrations:** Highlight a selection of GitHub repos with explanations and live demos.
- **Resume Parity:** A dedicated section mirroring your resume details, including skills, experience, and achievements.

---

#### **SMART Goal Breakdown:**

- **Specific**  
  The website must include:
  - A portfolio grid or dedicated sections for showcasing selected GitHub projects.
  - A comprehensive resume section that reflects your work history and skills.
  
- **Measurable**  
  Progress will be tracked by setting small, incremental goals:
  - Complete design mockups by [specific date].
  - Set milestones for each page (e.g., homepage, portfolio, resume, contact).
  - Define deadlines for project sections and integration tasks.
  
- **Assignable**  
  Define generic steps that any software engineer should follow when building a portfolio website:
  - **Design:** Create layout and wireframes (assignable to the designer or performed by the developer).
  - **Development:** Code the website using a chosen framework (e.g., React, Next.js) with iterative testing.
  - **Deployment:** Configure DNS for austingibb.com, set up hosting, and automate the deployment process.
  
- **Realistic**  
  - **Technology & Tools:** Stick to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles. Use simple, well-documented frameworks and hosting solutions to ensure an elegant and maintainable build.
  - **Budget & Time:** Use cost-effective solutions that meet your requirements without overcomplicating the build.
  
- **Time-Bound**  
  - **Deadline:** Aim to have at least a functional version of the website accessible by **March 10th, 2025**. This short-term deadline will help maintain momentum and ensure rapid progress.

#### **Next Steps:**

1. Finalize the design and layout details.
2. Break down the development process into smaller, timed projects.
3. Set up the domain and initial hosting environment.
4. Begin coding and track progress against the defined milestones.

This structured approach ensures that the portfolio website is not only visually appealing and informative but is also built in a manageable, step-by-step manner.
