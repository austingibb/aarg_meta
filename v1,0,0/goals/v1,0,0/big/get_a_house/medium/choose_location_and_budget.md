# Choose Location & Budget

## Overview
Identifying the right location and setting a realistic budget are foundational steps in buying a house.

## Steps:
1. **Define Location Priorities** – Research neighborhoods based on work commute, amenities, schools, crime rates, and community preferences.
2. **Analyze Market Prices** – Review recent home sales in desired areas to determine affordability.
3. **Set a Maximum Budget** – Define the highest possible price within financial constraints.
4. **Compare Rent vs. Buy Scenarios** – Ensure purchasing is financially advantageous compared to renting in the chosen location.

## Dependencies:
- Requires financial readiness (see `build_financial_readiness.md`)

## Outcome:
- Defined budget and location criteria for home search.
