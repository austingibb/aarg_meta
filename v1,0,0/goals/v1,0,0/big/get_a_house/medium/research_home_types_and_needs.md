Understanding different home types and personal living requirements is essential for making an informed purchase.

## Steps:
1. **Evaluate Home Types** – Consider single-family homes, condos, townhouses, and duplexes.
2. **Determine Space Requirements** – Identify the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and any special requirements (e.g., home office, garage).
3. **Assess Future Growth Needs** – Ensure the home can accommodate potential lifestyle changes (e.g., family expansion).
4. **Factor in Maintenance Costs** – Understand long-term upkeep requirements for different property types.

## Dependencies:

## Outcome:
- A well-defined list of home preferences and essential features.
