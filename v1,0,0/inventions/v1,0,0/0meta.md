# aarg.inventions.v1,0,0 Meta Document

## **Overview**
The `aarg.inventions` system is a structured repository for managing, developing, and tracking inventions across multiple disciplines. Each invention follows a **spec-driven** approach and progresses through defined **development stages**, ensuring scalability and reproducibility.

## **Versioning System**
- Inventions follow the **aarg standard versioning system**: `v<major>,<minor>,<patch>`.
- Example: `AIChatbot.v1,0,0`
- Each invention contains a `meta.md` file that documents its **purpose, structure, and dependencies**.

## **Invention Categories**
Inventions are organized into **major domains** based on their area of application:

- **Electronics & Hardware** – Embedded systems, circuit designs, IoT devices.
- **Chemistry** – Material science, chemical synthesis, experimental compounds.
- **Software** – Applications, AI models, game development, open-source software.
- **Robotics** – Autonomous systems, drones, mechanical engineering.
- **Mechanical & Engineering** – Structural designs, kinetic devices, non-electronic inventions.

### **Software Subcategories**
- **Game Dev** – Independent games, engines, game-related tooling.
- **Modding** – Enhancements or modifications to existing software or games.
- **Machine Learning** – AI models, training pipelines, research-based software.
- **Open Source** – General software projects meant for public release.

## **Invention Status Tags**
Each invention is labeled with one of the following **development status tags** in the filename:

- **THEORY** – Conceptual ideas that have not yet been tested or prototyped.
- **PROTO** – Early-stage prototypes with some level of physical or software implementation.
- **REPRO** – Fully developed inventions with complete documentation, reproducible results, and potentially an open-source repo.
